    Spring Stereotype Annotations

        @Component
            applicable for any class
            to create spring bean
            Specialization of @Component
                @Service
                    For business logic
                @Controller
                    controller class
                @Repository
                    if a bean a talking to a database

             use most specific annotation as possible for the class
             if it required business logic use service, if it plays with database use repository

             So using this u can help framework about ur intentions
             thus can use AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
